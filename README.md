Government Spending Contracts (Enigma)
What’s Enigma?
Enigma is a data operations and intelligence startup based in New York City. We build data infrastructure,
industry-specific solutions and provide data for commercial workflows. We have also built a free platform
to connect a wider world of people to public data, Enigma Public.
What’s the dataset?
In 2016 alone the U.S. government spent over $3 trillion dollars. Government procurement is a sizeable
part of the U.S. economy — as procurement overall is a sizeable part of the global economy. This
Government Spending Contracts dataset includes over 15 years of contracts, from 2000-2017, with the
federal government. The data is quite granular, including not only the vendor who won the contract, the
value of the contract, the agency within the federal government relevant to the contract and 200+ other
columns of details.
Digging into government procurement data, i.e. where the government is spending money, reveals a lot
about government priorities, as well as the types of businesses that are receiving contracts. For the past
few decades the federal government has instituted supplier diversity programs whereby they have
attempted to diversify the types of businesses winning government contracts. To what extent have they
been successful?
A recent project of note on a similar topic was Steve Ballmer’s USAFacts site, though that project aimed
at covering the topical impact of spending, rather than examining the companies with which the money
was being spent.
